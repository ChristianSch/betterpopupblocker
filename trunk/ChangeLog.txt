Better Pop Up Blocker 1.0.0 July 26th, 2010
First public version.

Better Pop Up Blocker 1.1.0 July 27th, 2010
Fixed the browser action pop up to accept unicode urls.
Injected javascript code now removes itself to prevent other code from being able to parse it's variables.

Better Pop Up Blocker 1.1.1 July 27th, 2010
Added support for blocking the less common window.showModalDialog and window.showModelessDialog methods.
Reversed the self-removal of javascript in 1.1.0 since there are easier ways to parse the variables.

Better Pop Up Blocker 1.2.0 July 29th, 2010
Added support for preventing infinite prompt/alert/confirm/print/window pop up attacks in Google Chrome when you allow a site to use these functions.
The protection is provided as long as the extension is running and a maximum of 30 for each group of prompt/alert/confirm, print, and window pop ups.
Fixed the use of incorrect regular expressions shown on the Options page. Before, the example regular expressions were not correctly escaped,
but they still whitelisted the sites you want.
V1.2 will automatically corrects the default regular expressions from older versions. Please check your own regular expressions if you followed the examples.

Better Pop Up Blocker 1.3.0 August 2nd, 2010
Much better looking whitelister buttons and uses the url bar icon instead of a browser button.
Reworked the blocking for document.createEvent so that it doesn't interfere with sites using it in whitelist mode.
Started to convert Better Pop Up Blocker so that it also works as a Safari extension.

Better Pop Up Blocker 1.5.0 August 4th, 2010
Reworked the reloading of the tabs after a whitelisting option is made with the whitelister so that the applicable tabs are loaded instead of just one.
Better Pop Up Blocker now works as a Safari extension using the same code! Next stop is Firefox.
